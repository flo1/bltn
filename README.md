At the first run, the configuration file /home/$USER/.config/bltn/bltn.conf is
created. You can also change the variables :
- $SYNCDIR is the location where the list of links is saved. You can
  synchronise this directory between your computers.
- $LOCALDIR is the location where local copies are saved. This directory
  doesn't need to be synchronised.

Run "bltn --help" to see the list of available options.

You can add keybord shortcuts for the following scripts :
- bltn-add-article

Now when you see a page in your browser, you can quickly add it or remove it.
This should works at least with Firefox and Chromium.
