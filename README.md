ril
===

Shell script to save and manage web pages, for reading later or when you are
offline.

At the first run, the configuration file /home/$USER/.config/ril/ril.conf is
created. You can also change the variables.

$ARTICLESDIR is where the list of links is saved. You can synchronise this
directory between your computers.

$STOREDIR is where local copies of web pages are saved. This directory doesn't
need to be synchronised.

Run "ril --help" for a list of available options.
